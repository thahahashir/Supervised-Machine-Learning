# Supervised-Machine-Learning
Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
## Y = f(x)

Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.

Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.
